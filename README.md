Data Modeling, Performance Optimization & Text Analytics in Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on transforming a raw real estate dataset into a scalable, high-performance business intelligence model using Power BI and Power Query.

The original dataset contained over 15,000 property records with 47+ columns, including highly repetitive categorical fields and large unstructured text descriptions. Directly visualising this data resulted in inefficient storage and limited analytical flexibility.

To address this, I applied dimensional modelling, data normalization, and text restructuring techniques to improve data quality, reduce redundancy, and enable advanced exploratory analysis.
